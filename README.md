# Genome Editing Trading Cards
This repository contains the genome editing trading cards that is made using open-source data from the [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/). Software used includes `Chimera` and `Inkscape`.

`Meganucleases` `ZFNs` `TALENs` `CRISPR-Cas` `BaseEditors` `PrimeEditor`
## Credits
Credit should be given to Kartik Lakshmi Rallapalli (`@kartik_lakshmi`), Paesani Lab (`@PaesaniLab`) and Komor Lab (`@KomorLab`). It would be great if you could tweet about the cards, how you used it in your project and tag us in your post!
